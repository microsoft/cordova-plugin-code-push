     *         - Otherwise, the update package will be downloaded and applied with no user interaction.
     * - If no update is available on the server, or if a previously rolled back update is available and the ignoreFailedUpdates is set to true, the syncCallback will be invoked with the SyncStatus.UP_TO_DATE.
